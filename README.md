Weather App (Flutter)

Description: Developed a weather application using Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. The app provides real-time weather information based on the user's current location using geolocation services and integrates with the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data.

Key Contributions:

Implemented geolocation functionality to retrieve the user's current location using the Geolocator package.
Integrated asynchronous data fetching using the HTTP package to communicate with the OpenWeather API.
Designed an intuitive user interface with animated transitions and responsive layouts.
Implemented dynamic data rendering to display weather forecasts, current conditions, and additional information.
Utilized state management techniques such as setState and FutureBuilder to update the UI based on asynchronous data retrieval.
Implemented error handling to gracefully handle scenarios such as network errors and API response errors.
Collaborated with a team of designers and QA engineers to ensure the app met design specifications and quality standards.
Technologies Used:
